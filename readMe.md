# Parser for a given contextfree grammar implemented in Java

Context-free grammars are used extensively in modelling the syntax of programming languages. A parser is the first stage of a compiler for these languages. A parser is the implementation of an algorithm to determine whether a given string is generated by the production rules of a given context-free grammar and, if so, it constructs a parse tree of the string. The compiler will then continue its processing by translating the parse tree into low-level machine code, performing various steps that we will not see (and are beyond the scope of this course). More than one algorithm exist that can be used for parsing.

This code consists in implementing a specific algorithm for parsing, that determines whether a specific grammar can generate some strings (or words) and, if so, it produces the parse tree for those strings.

In this specific task we consider the following grammar:

We consider a non-ambiguous grammar G that generates the language of syntactically correct boolean expressions involving disjunction, conjunction, negation and only two identifiers for propositions.
